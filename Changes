        - Depend on B::Utils 0.05_06.
        - The (getter) Accessor plugin now extracts the hash key name
          using the new opgrep() "capture" feature.
        - Depend on Class::XSAccessor 0.02.

0.02  Thu Apr  3 17:09 2008
        - Move all the XS code to a separate module since the
          code may be useful without the funny scanning features.
